This repository implements classification algorithms for stress detection
The featured algorithms are: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and SVC (Support Vector Classification)


It also implements a real time visualization of EEG data from the Curvex headset with
the ability to record the signal for further use.

Some visualization tools are also presents that include: display of confusion matrices, spectrogram display, 
dimensionality reduced data (PCA) display, etc.
